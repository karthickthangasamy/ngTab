                JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language. It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so
                that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and
                alter the document content that was displayed.[5] More recently, however, it has become common in both game
                development and the creation of desktop applications.
